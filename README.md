# Wikimedia-Resource-Center
A single point of entry for all Wikimedia-related resources

Hi! Welcome to the Wikimedia Resource Center. This is a space for contributors to the Wikimedia movement to share what they learned, ask questions and connect to one another for support. 

Anyone can contribute to the Wikimedia Resource Center. Including you! Have you recently documented a process? Do you have a guide that would be useful to others? Have you run a workshop that other people might like? Share it here. 

There are two components to sharing resources on this platform: audience and category. The audience is the group of people you are addressing. In the Wikimedia Resource Center, we are focusing on 4 audience groups: 

- Program leaders (Wikimedians who help run edit-a-thons, photo contests, Wikipedians in Residence, etc.), 

- Contributors (Wikimedians who contribute content on Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, Wikidata, Wikivoyage, etc) 

- Volunteer developers (those who contribute code to our projects, by writing bots, Lua models, etc)

- Affiliate organizers (Wikimedians who are invested in organizing a local Wikimedia user group, chapter, or thematic organization)


The category refers to the area your resource is addressing. We have identified 10 areas for contribution: Contact and questions, skills development, grant support, program support, software basics, software development, technical infrastructure, global reach partnerships, legal, communications. We believe these areas cover all resource types. If you think none of them apply to the resource you want to share, please email us at eval@wikimedia.org, or leave a comment on the [[m:Talk:Wikimedia Resource Center|talk page]]. 


Connect to others!

People are the very essence of our movement. When we connect to others, we learn faster, better and the knowledge stays with us for longer. Consider adding your profile or starting a group on [[m:Connect|Connect]] if you see an area of expertise, or want to share your skills or answer questions for Wikimedians who are only now beginning to grow in the movement. 

Newcomers may have many questions: how do I start a user group? What things should I consider before I start? How do I establish a partnership with a museum? For all these questions, seasoned advice is key. 

Check this space frequently, to see what questions people ask, and how you can help others.
