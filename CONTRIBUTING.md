# Welcome! :sparkles: 
In this project, we are looking forward to creating a directory of individuals and groups in the Wikimedia movement, to better connect people to other community members that can support them.

Thank you for joining this project. My name is [Mar√≠a Cruz](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:MCruz_(WMF)), I am a communications manager in the Community Engagement department at the Wikimedia Foundation. My project, the [Wikimedia Resource Center](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WRC) was designed as a single point of entry for all Wikimedia-related resources. In this phase of the project, we are developing the social connecting features. 

Since this is a section of a larger project, I consider it a small project, and a small contribution as well. Contributors should be familiar with mediawiki environment, and be able to write a js script.
