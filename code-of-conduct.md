This is a code of conduct for Wikimedia technical spaces. It applies both within physical spaces, such as Wikimedia technical events and Wikimedia technical presentations in other events, and virtual spaces (MediaWiki.org, [wikitech.wikimedia.org](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/), [Phabricator](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Phabricator), [Gerrit](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Gerrit), [technical mailing lists](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mailing_lists/Overview#MediaWiki_and_technical), [technical IRC channels](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC/Channels#MediaWiki_and_technical), [Etherpad](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Etherpad), and other development-oriented spaces operated by the Wikimedia Foundation).

## Principles

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we are committed to making participation in Wikimedia technical projects a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sex, sexual orientation, disability, neuroatypicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, political affiliation, or religion.

Technical skills and community status make no difference to the right to be respected and the obligation to respect others. Newcomers and other contributors with limited experience in our community deserve a welcoming attitude and constructive feedback. Prolific contributions and technical expertise are not a justification for lower standards of behavior.

## Unacceptable behavior:

Harassment and other types of inappropriate behavior are unacceptable in all public and private Wikimedia technical spaces. Examples include but are not limited to:

* Personal attacks, violence, threats of violence, or deliberate intimidation.
* Offensive, derogatory, or discriminatory comments.
* Gratuitous or off-topic use of sexual language or imagery.
* Inappropriate or unwanted attention, touching, or physical contact (sexual or otherwise).
* Inappropriate or unwanted public or private communication, following, or any form of stalking.
* Unwanted photography or recording.
* Disclosure of a person's identity or other private information without their consent. Disclosure of some identifying information is not consent to disclose other identifying information.
* Inappropriate or unwanted publication of private communication. Publishing or reporting private communication or personally identifying information for the purposes of reporting harassment (as explained here) and/or in the case of whistleblowing, is acceptable.
* Harming the discussion or community with methods such as sustained disruption, interruption, or blocking of community collaboration (i.e. trolling).
* Discrimination, particularly against marginalized and otherwise underrepresented groups. Targeted outreach to such groups is allowed and encouraged.
* Using the code of conduct system for purposes other than reporting genuine violations of the code of conduct (e.g., retaliating against a reporter or victim by filing a report claiming their response was harassment).
* Attempting to circumvent a decision of the [Committee](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct/Committee) or appeals body, e.g. unblocking someone during a period the Committee banned them.
